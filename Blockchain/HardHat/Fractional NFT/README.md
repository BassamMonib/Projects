Objective: Make a solidity project that has 2 modules named as
I) Blockship NFT Marketplace
II) NFT Fractions Manager

The goal is to make it possible for people to enlist their nfts on this marketplace and distribute the partial ownership of it to multiple people in such a way that when it is auctioned for e.g for 2eth and 2 people are it's partial owners than they both earn 1eth of the auctioned price.

The person who enlists it has maximum ownership and he/she distributes the nft ownership shares on a pre-set market price.
